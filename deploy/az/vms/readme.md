## Create VM with Docker installed

There are two options for creating VM machines with Docker installed:

1. [Deploying a Linux VM to run single-server development environment using docker-machine (**Recommended for development environments**)](./docker-machine.md)
2. [Deploying a Linux VM or Windows Server 2016 to run a single-server development environment using ARM template (**Recommended for creating testing environments**)](./plain-vm.md)

If you want to create a VM for deploying images you build locally, then use the first option.

If you want to create a VM to run images deployed to DockerHub (to provide some test environment) then use the second option.
