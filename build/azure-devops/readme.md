# Azure DevOps build definitions

This folder contains the Azure DevOps build definitions in YAML format. Each folder contains one `azure-pipelines.yml` that contains the build definition for one microservice (usually a Docker image, but some microservices generates more than one Docker image).

For more information about YAML builds read the [Azure DevOps documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started-yaml?view=azure-devops).
