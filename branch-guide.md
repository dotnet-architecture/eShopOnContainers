# eShopOnContainers - BRANCH GUIDE

Following are the most important branches:

- `dev`: Contains the latest code **and it is the branch actively developed**. Note that **all PRs must be against the `dev` branch to be considered**. This branch is developed using `.NET 5`
- `main`: Synced time to time from `dev`.It contains "stable" code, although not the latest one. Right now, this branch contains changes specific to `.NET Core 3.1`

Any other branch is considered temporary and could be deleted at any time. Do not submit any PR against them!

Thanks!
