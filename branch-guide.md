# eShopOnContainers - BRANCH GUIDE

Following are the most important branches:

- `dev`: Contains the latest code **and it is the branch actively developed**. Note that **all PRs must be against `dev` branch to be considered**. This branch is developed using .NET Core 2.0
- `master`: Synced time to time from dev. It contains "stable" code, although not the latest one. We plan to do periodic merges from `dev` to `master`, but we are not doing it right now.

Any other branch is considered temporary and could be deleted at any time. Do not do any PR to them!

Thanks!
